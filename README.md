# RosalindBioinformatics

A collection of various bioinformatics-related exercise
solutions in Python.

The exercises come from [The Rosalind Project](https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) where I solve them on my free time.

These scripts are not intended to be used practically as 
their main purpose is helping me internalize bioinformatics
and Python concepts.
